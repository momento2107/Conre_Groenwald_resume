    <p>Hi, my name is Conré. I am 19 years old and living in Observatory, Cape Town. Currently I'm studying Full Stack Web Development at HyperionDev in Woodstock. Here is a little background about me.</p>
    <p>I grew up in a small town called Mossel Bay. As a young boy I had the world at my feet and I've been dreaming big my whole life. I love going surfing, skating, hiking, chasing the sunset, running and in general just being out in nature. Enjoying life as it is given to us by our Heavenly Father and living in the moment. Don't get me wrong I love being indoors as well. Sleeping, watching movies, making coffee and chilling, because at some point we all need our rest.</p>
    <p>Through my life I've experienced so much. I've travelled to 10 countries across the globe, taught myself (by learning from others) a bunch of skills that helped me grow into the person I am today. And I am only 19 years old!!! Through all my experiences and everything I have learned I always had one passion. One thing that has driven me to get up in the morning. To help people in ways that others can't. I believe God gave me this passion to help grow His kingdom on earth. So as soon as I finished school, I turned my passion into a business. It was always my dream to have my own business and to be self-employed.</p>

    <p>Growing up I was interested in a lot of career choices and it just seemed like I couldn't make up my mind. So when I finished school I decided to do it all.</p>
    <h4>High School</h4>
    <p>I matriculated at the High Agricultural School Oakdale in Riversdale, Western Cape. Through my 5 years of high school I learnt so much about myself and life. I gained knowledge in as many fields as possible. Photograpy, writing, video editing, public speaking, leadership, fitness coaching and training, organizing, team management, waitering and bartending. In my last two years of high school I worked as a bartender and waiter during holidays at two different restaurants. High school was a great experience but none of what have I learned prepared me for what was to coming.</p>
    <h4>Life After School</h4>
    <p> After I finished high school I moved to Cape Town for my studies. I was never one for studying longer than three years and focussing on one thing. So I decided to attend short courses which provided me with the practical skills, knowledge/theory of the industry. What I've realized is that the world is moving from what you know (your degree and what you studied) towards what you can DO (what skills you have). So I took a big risk but so far it has been paying off. In just one year I finished my Bussiness Management, Entrepreneurship and New Technologies diploma, Adobe Premiere Pro Video Editing Certificate and Basic Bartending Certificate. In that same year I worked as a retail Sales Rep for 3 months, and as a general worker for a Bridal Fair.</p>
    <p>Currenlty I am studying Full Stack Web Development at HyperionDev. It's a very practical course teaching me more than just the basics of web development. In my free time I am bartending for mobile bar companies at events. I am also managing my own business, The Leaf. The Leaf hasn't been registered yet but we are already on social media to market our brand and putting our name out there. You can follow us on instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/itsthe_leaf/?igshid=1qtw5li5rx71q">here</a>.</p>
    <p>The Leaf is a christian based brand spreading the word of God in more ways one. The plan is to be involved in many different industries for example, restaurant, fitness, clothing, radio/podcast channel, surfing and skateboarding community, hosting camps, seminars, doing outreaches and many more.</p>
